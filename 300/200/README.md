# 200 - Setting up The Database Connection

Open a file called ```app.py``` in your ```app``` directory. This file will have code for setting up the database and your Flask routes:

```
$ mkdir app
$ cd app
$ touch app.py
```

This file will connect to an SQLite database called ```database.db```, and have a class called ```Student``` that represents your database students table for storing student information, in addition to your Flask routes. Add the following ```import``` statements at the top of ```app.py```:

```python title="app.py"
...
import os
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, url_for, redirect
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.sql import func
```
app/app.py

Here, you import the [```os``` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), which gives you access to miscellaneous operating system interfaces. You’ll use it to construct a file path for your ```database.db``` database file.

From the ```flask``` package, you then import the necessary helpers you need for your application: the ```Flask``` class to create a Flask application instance, the ```render_template()``` function to render templates, the ```request``` object to handle requests, the ```url_for()``` function to construct URLs for routes, and the ```redirect()``` function for redirecting users. For more information on routes and templates, see [How To Use Templates in a Flask Application](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-a-flask-application).

You then import the ```SQLAlchemy``` class from the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension, which gives you access to all the functions and classes from SQLAlchemy, in addition to helpers, and functionality that integrates Flask with SQLAlchemy. You’ll use it to create a database object that connects to your Flask application, allowing you to create and manipulate tables using Python classes, objects, and functions without needing to use the SQL language.

You also import the ```func``` helper from the ```sqlalchemy.sql``` module to access [SQL functions](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/tutorial/data_select.html#working-with-sql-functions). You’ll need it in your database management system to set a default creation date and time for when a database record is created.

**WARNING**: You may encounter the following:

```

We do **not** have a solution for above error as of yet. :(

If no error, continue:

```
$ pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
```

```
$ pip install -U spacy
```

Run the following command which will download the [spacy](https://spacy.io/usage/models) NLP language model.

If so, make sure you have ran ```$ pip install -U spacy```. Then try again.
